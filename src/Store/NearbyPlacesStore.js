      "Sunset Point is a vantage point located in Agumbe, Karnataka.Located on the Udupi-Agumbe road, it is one of the popular viewpoints in Agumbe and among the top Agumbe tourist places. Perched at a height of 825 m above sea level, the Sunset Point is one of the highest peaks of the Western Ghats offering a bewitching view of the setting sun on the horizon of the Arabian Sea. This point is situated at the 14th hairpin bend of the ghat road that leads to Agumbe and attracts many tourists every year.  One can have a splendid view of the setting sun along with some panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and even the Arabian Sea on a clear day. The color of the sun as it slips into the sea looks amazingly beautiful from Sunset Point.",

      "Kavaledurga is ancient hill fort situated near Shimoga in Karnataka that is perched at a height of 1541 metres. Although in ruins right now, the hill fort is still considered to be one of the most scenic and enchanting places in the state. Engulfed in greenery, the fort is surrounded by the majestic Western Ghats. The heritage spot is a hidden secret in the region and therefore is devoid of the typical tourist crowd. The fort can be reached through a trek uphill that might be a little tiring but the view at the top will make it all worthwhile.",
